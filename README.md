To generate a mesh file, use the script "make_mesh_3d.py", which produces the output file: box3d-t_0.25-nx_80-ny_64-nz_48.mesh

Next, create the corresponding material file mat.xml and ensure it is correctly formatted for the simulation.

Finally, execute the new.cfs file to run the simulation.

Output: .dat file
